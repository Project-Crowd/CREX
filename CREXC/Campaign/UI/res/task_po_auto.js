Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) to streamline the process to ???further unleash the power of this important energy source,?? without loosening key environmental protections.  With broad bi-partisan support for hydropower, we have a unique opportunity to take advantage of our nation??s largest source of clean energy and help realize its potential to create good jobs in Colorado and across the nation. After unanimously passing the House earlier this year, the time is now for the Senate to act and secure a smarter, cleaner energy policy. ",

In the days before refrigeration, salt was essential for preserving meat and curing leather. The Bluffton-Tow Salt Works were one of a handful of sources of salt for the Confederacy.  During the war, every day the residents of Tow would produce 20 to 30 bushels of salt.  In 1852, David and Gideon Cowan and their mother, Ruth, were the first settlers in the area. Local Indians showed them salt beds near the Colorado River, which they developed into saltworks.  A year later, John F. Morgan and his family were the first settlers to live in the area.  They established a hat business, using beaver and other fur trapped locally.  William and Wilson Tow also moved to the area in 1853 and  named the nearby area in which they settled Tow Valley. I am proud of the rich history of the towns and cities in the 11th District.  Men like the Cowans and John Morgan are the type of entrepreneurs that built America and give me faith in our future. ",

He graduated from John Marshall High School and leaves behind a wife and two young kids.   The government shutdown impeded Angel??s wife ability to receive his last paycheck. But fortunately, the House and Senate recently passed H.J.Res. 91, a funding bill to allow the Pentagon to pay military death benefits despite the government shutdown.  Now Angel??s family no longer has to worry about costs such as his burial expense.  At least 2,146 members of the U.S. military, 132 this year alone, have died due to the Afghanistan conflict. This 12-year-old war has resulted in far too many casualties and I look forward to the day when all of our troops can be safely brought home.    My thoughts and prayers are with the Lopez family. ",

            "0": " Day 30: It may be the last day of the #SamFarrChallenge but for me it's the beginning of a healthier year. Why not extend it to the end of the year?   The walking was a wonderful challenge. Most days I made it 7,000 steps or more. Some days way over, while others as low as 4,000 but it has made a difference. Hardest part for me was the bed time snacks and of course the ice cream. I can't completely give it up but I can limit the amount. I found alcohol wasn't a problem though occasionally hard during a late dinner with friends. I limited it to 1 or 2 glasses of red wine and then rest of the evening drank water.   I found my weight fluctuated during the challenge. I lost some and gained back some over the past few weeks. Thankfully, overall it was a net loss. I am now going to try and lose 25 more lbs over the year.   Thank you for all the kind notes during the challenge. They really helped keep going on the first lap. Of course I want to thank Mary for inspiring me to do this challenge. Her helpful hints made us all better informed about the consequences of the food we eat. Finally, congratulations to everyone who completed the challenge. It was a lot of fun doing this as a group and I hope you all feel healthier. If you are able to make it to one of my town halls, I would love to hear your success stories or feel free to share them here. ",

Lewallen was born in the 11th District town of Blackwell in 1919.  He rode roughstock in rodeos from 1936 until retiring in 1956.   Along the way he competed in rodeo's in Madison Square Garden and married Rockettes dancer Ethel Spanier.  G.K. and Ethel opened what is now Chick Elms Rodeo Shop and Grand Entry Western Store in Stephenville.  In a story in the Stephenville Empire Tribune, Suzi Robertson remembered his generosity the year she entered a rodeo queen contest.  ???I went into his store and picked out a new white hat and white pearlized boots,\" Robertson said. \"When I went to the register to pay, he told me I owed him nothing, but to do my best. What an encouragement to a teenager. May all the cowboys in heaven welcome him home.?? Yes, may all the cowboys welcome G.K. Lewallen home.   This is a photograph of G.K. in the Great Falls, Montana, rodeo in 1939. ",

By all historical accounts this was the day that saved the world from tyranny.  It was an overwhelming honor to meet with many veterans, including my friend Jack Port recently featured as one of San Diego's attending heroes.  What was so impressive in meeting these veterans as they have reached or are approaching their nineties, is to acknowledge that many were not even in their twenties on that epoch day.  I will never forget how much I learned and the emotions I felt.  I wish I could have shared it with my Dad who served as a medic throughout the war but like so many of his compatriots moved on with his life and did not speak about his experience.  During his remarks, President Hollande of France quoted President Eisenhower: Americans were not sure what they were fighting for in Europe, but in liberating the concentration camps they knew what they were fighting against.

The group will distribute the yummy treats to some of our service men and women who are single, living in the barracks at JBER and are far away from their families this Christmas.  If you are able, please consider giving to your favorite local charity so that all Alaskans might have a holiday season that is just a little brighter.

            "0": " Yesterday, speaking on the floor of the House of Representatives, I shared a story that is close to my heart. A few years ago, my 96 year old mother was diagnosed with an aneurysm close to her heart. Due to her advanced age, the doctors believed that surgery was too risky. A few years later that aneurysm got worse, endangering her life. She was re-evaluated, and the doctors concluded that she would not survive without surgery.  Putting her faith in her doctors, in our healthcare system and in her god, she chose to have the surgery. Fortunately she made a full recovery. However, none of this would have been possible without Medicare. My mother worked her entire life as a domestic worker, and did not have a private pension or any option other than Medicare. As Congressional Republicans look for an easy way out on these issues, it is people like my mother who are left behind. This is a personal issue to me and the millions of American families with similar stories.  Republicans have tried for years to destroy Medicare by turning it in to a voucher program. They would break the promise we made to our nation??s seniors, that if they worked hard they would be taken care of in their old age. Medicare is the most efficient health plan in our country, boasting an overhead of only 2%. The problem isn??t Medicare; it??s the rising cost of healthcare.   One major reason our healthcare costs keep going up is because we have not changed the way patients and doctors see each other. We must be innovative and creative in tackling the cost of healthcare. As the Representative of Silicon Valley, I have led the way in this by promoting innovative technologies such a telemedicine, personal health connected devices, and other tools. I will be reintroducing the Healthcare Innovation and Marketplace Technologies Act later this year to continue this effort. Most importantly, however, I will continue to stand with my friends here in the Congress to protect Medicare and the Medicare guarantee. ",

GAO found 31 new opportunities to provide significant savings that Congress should act on immediately.  GAO also found that 12 percent of the 131 areas GAO identified in its past two reports were addressed, while 66 percent were partially addressed and nearly 21 percent were not addressed.  Clearly, progress is needed in reducing unnecessary spending and duplication.  With a soaring national debt, federal program overlap must be part of common-sense spending reductions. ",

She has answered over 1000 questions, which is unprecedented. The maximum number before was in the three hundreds. When Lisa Jackson was confirmed, there were about 100 questions asked.    This has been a pattern on the Republican side of the aisle with obstructing President Obama??s nominations. Yesterday we saw, in one of our committees, a technical rule used to block the vote for Tom Perez to be Secretary of Labor.

Kagan said, \"This was not meant to be a 'value free' exercise; on the contrary, its purpose was to communicate the special virtues of republican representative democracy, the dangers that threatened it, and the responsibility of its citizens to esteem and protect it. This education was to be a common experience for all citizens, rich and poor, for every one of them had natural rights and powers, and every one had to understand and esteem the institutions, laws and traditions of his country if it was to succeed.\" ",
