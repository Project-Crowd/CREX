The initial StarWars Pinball download comes with the Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back table. Other Star Wars Pinball tables can be purchased as in-app purchases.  Additional Star Wars Pinball tables are coming soon!  May the Force be with you!  **For players already enjoying Star Wars   Pinball tables in Zen Pinball HD, we want to give you a heads up that there is no way for us to transfer purchases or make tables available in both apps. Thanks for your support!**  What the Press Are Saying:  GamesRadar  As a complete package, Star Wars Pinball delivers the kind of arcade experience that makes you crave just one more game, constantly chasing to surpass your own score for the sheer satisfaction of it.   Desctructoid - 9.5/10  Each table is chock full of beautiful art, character cameos, and tracks pulled straight from the films' soundtracks. These first three tables are a bold and equally stellar introduction to Star Wars Pinball, and they'll keep you more than busy until Zen Studios drops the next batch.   Game Informer - 8.5/10  You don't need to be a Star Wars fan to recognize the creativity Zen has brought to the new tables. The company continues to include more fantasy elements in its designs.   CNET - 8.9/10 The best thing about Star Wars Pinball is its jaw-dropping graphics. The many targets, ramps, rollovers, and kickers that make up its pinball course are all polished with incredible detail. Even the pinball itself is stunning, with its metallic surface realistically reflecting the ambient lights as it spins across the table. And the choreographed flashing of all these table elements really make you feel as though Zen Studios pulled out all the stops when making this game.  Penny Arcade Report (Ben Kuchera)  If you're a fan of pinball, Star Wars, or fun things, this is pretty much a must-purchase.   ### Be sure to visit us at www.zenpinball.com.

For discussion and support: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1347899  - MANUAL -  Flashing with Mobile ODIN is easy. You start by starting the app and the app will check your system has everything it needs to continue (like root). It may need to download an additional package, so it is advised you have Wi-Fi available.  Now you should see the main Mobile ODIN screen. It will list a set of partitions. Clicking a partition will allow you to select a file from your SD card to flash to that partition. Do not worry about selecting the wrong file - Mobile ODIN will not let you. Separate files (named after the partition) as well as .tar and .tar.md5 files are supported.  From the desktop ODIN you may be used to  PDA ,  PHONE , and  CSC  buttons. All three of these buttons have been replaced by the  Open file ...  button. This button will open the file you select from the SD card, and find all the partitions it can flash inside that file. So if you select a .tar file containing kernel and modem, the Kernel and Modem partitions will be set up to use that .tar file for flashing.  Now that we have selected what we want to flash, if you have the Pro version you can proceed to the EverRoot section. The EverRoot options allows you to root your firmware while it is being flashed. Never again will you be without root! Select here which apps you want to inject in the firmware that is being flashed.  Now that we are all done selecting partitions and configuring EverRoot, we continue to  Flash firmware . Mobile ODIN will gather all the information it needs and perform the flash. Before starting, however, it will check that your battery level is over 50%, and if applicable offer to verify MD5 checksums on the files you have selected to flash. If all is well, it will reboot into recovery mode, and flash the firmware you have selected. </div></div><label for=\"post1700\" class=\"read-more-trigger\"></label>"},

This game was originally released as the world's first poop rearing software in 1998 and has been continuously made improvements. Now the game gained world recognition and became a top-ranked poop rearing software amongst many rival games. The latest version 5.x finally adds support for mobile devices and allows you to take care of your poop anytime and anywhere, as well as having an intuitive touch interface makes it possible to better interact with the poop directly.  Take care of your poop on your smartphone or tablet right now!  ---------------- Overview ----------------  - The birth of Poop  The first time you launch the software, it will prompt you to enter the name of your poop. Name your poop and tap  OK , then your poop will appear on the screen (the screen may appear darker and the images could be difficult to see during the night). Your poop is now born.   - Poop is alive  The poop is alive. It has 365 days a year just like us. Even though you exit the software, your poop grows up. (Don't worry, it won't consume any battery when off). Raise your poop with constant love and attention: it will grow up and improve physical abilities.  - Feed Poop  The most basic method of rearing a poop is to feed a meal. Select a meal from the Feeding menu at the bottom of the screen and bring it to the center of your poop. As you successfully feed your poop, it will be satisfied. The poop is influenced by what it eats, so make sure you feed it balanced meals. If your poop shapes a curlicue poo after several meals, it means your poop is full. Feed it 3 to 5 times a day.  - Communicate with Poop  You can communicate with your poop by touching it. Don't leave it alone for a long time, otherwise it feels lonely. You can shape your poop by touching it, turning or pulling it up and down. The poop feels happy when you touch it. However, touching it too much could prevent its growth.  Tap the poop to poke it. Poking makes it happy but don't do it too much. It will get angry.  - Keep Poop Indoor  The poop stays outside at first but you can also keep it indoor. Select indoor from the Environment menu to move it indoor. It is healthier to keep the poop outside, however it is safer to keep it indoor as you can avoid weather changes.  - Observe Poop  Raise your poop properly otherwise it may feel lonely or get sick without even noticing. Select Observe from the Observe menu to check the condition of your poop from time to time.  Tap photo on the Observe menu to take a picture. It is also fun to record stages of your poop's growth. The pictures will be stored in the Unko folder of the external memory, and you can view them later by using an image viewing application such as Android Gallery.  - Train Poop  When you get used to raise the poop, teach your poop tricks. In order to train your poop, first input a specific gesture that you want to teach around the poop. Even a newborn poop can learn tricks like a lateral move or spin.  [Gestures] Lateral move: Flick right or left Spin: Rub right and left  * The poop can learn the following moves as it grows up. Keep an eye on it as it achieves a new gesture.  Jump: Double tap Zoom out: Long tap Zoom in: Rub the screen widely Wiggle: Rub up and down Handstand: Flick down Stretch: Flick up  Specify a trick and tap around the poop. This is the sign to start the trick. The more you practice, the better your poop can be. If you a have trouble to teach it tricks, it could be a good idea to ask other owners. Your poop can do more than you can imagine. Input multiple gestures and tap or insert one trick after another. Your poop will show you combination tricks or splendid continuous tricks. You will build up ties with your poop before your poop can do acrobatic tricks. </div></div><label for=\"post1079\" class=\"read-more-trigger\"></label>"},

On some devices, a yellow triangle or other sort of visual warning is also displayed during boot if you are running a *custom* firmware. TriangleAway was built to disable the triangle (if a visual warning is present) and reset the custom ROM flash counter to 0. This app requires root ! You can find out the current status of your flash counter and firmware state (custom or official) by booting into  download mode  on most devices. The usual way of getting into  download mode  is by first turning off your device, then turning it on by pressing and holding VolDown+(Home)+Power. Alternatively, the  adb reboot download  command also often works.  When you run TriangleAway, if your device and firmware are supported, it will show you the detected state of the binary (custom or official) and flash counter value, and the option to  Reset flash counter . Please confirm that the information shown is correct before resetting the values.  On a number of devices, TriangleAway can work, but your firmware may not be supported directly. In that case, the app will tell you it needs to reboot into a special boot mode, which will be happen if you select  Reset flash counter . The device will reboot into a special mode which will allow you to review the current status and reset the binary and flash counter values (or abort and do nothing). On some devices this will actually trigger the counter to 1 if its 0 - so if you're  just checking , do that in download mode!  !!! THIS IS A DANGEROUS OPERATION AND COULD POTENTIALLY BRICK YOUR DEVICE. PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK. A USB JIG IS PREFERRED IF YOU HAVE A WORKING ONE !!! ( and by brick I mean brick - only a board replacement or a JTAG unit will be able to save you, don't mess with boot(loader) stuff unless you *really* mean it! )  Note#1: using Triangle Away may unmount your SD card. Reboot or manually remount it from Android settings.  Note#2: on new devices status can only be reset on stock firmwares!  Supported devices:  SG S2: - GT-I9100 ** - Sprint Epic 4G Touch - Korea SHW-M250K/L/S  SG S3: - GT-I9300/I9300T ** - GT-I9305/I9305T/I9305N LTE ** - USA: AT&T, Sprint, T-Mo, VZW (unlock bootloader !), USCC, MetroPCS, Cricket, CSpire - Canada - Korea: SHV-E210K/L/S, SHW-M440S  SG S4: - GT-I9505 - USA: AT&T, VZW, Sprint, T-Mo, USCC - Canada  SG Note: - GT-N7000 - GT-I9220  SG Note 2: - GT-N7100/N7100T/N7102/N7105/N7105T ** - USA: AT&T, Sprint, T-Mo, VZW (unlock bootloader !), USCC - Canada: I317M, T889V - Korea: SHV-E250K/L/S **  SG Note 3 (4.4+): - GT-N9005  - USA: T-Mobile, Sprint - Canada: SM-N900W8 - Asia: SM-N900S/2/6/8/9  SG Note 8.0 : - GT-N5100 3G ** - GT-N511x Wi-Fi ** - GT-N5120 LTE **  SG Note 10.1 : - GT-N8000 3G ** - GT-N801x Wi-Fi ** - GT-N8020 LTE ** - SHW-M480S/K/W **  SG Camera EK-GC100 **  SG Tab 2: - GT-P310x 7  3G - GT-P311x 7  Wi-Fi - GT-P510x 10.1  3G - GT-P511x 10.1  Wi-Fi  Various: - I8160, I8190 - I9070/P - I9082 - I9260 - S7500, S7560, S7562  ** Various models are supported depending on firmware, but only the exact models listed are supported regardless of firmware version.  Whether or not Triangle Away works may depend on your kernel, try flashing a different one if it doesn't work.  Please also note that some devices set the counter to 1 at every boot if you are running a custom kernel or recovery. On these devices, Triangle Away may always display 1 - make sure to check the counter in actual download mode.  For discussion and technical details, see the XDA-Developers.com thread here:  http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1494114  Note that this download is also available from that thread completely for free. You can go there and download it for free, or buy me a beer and download it from Play. It is the same program.  I'm not sure about future updates - http://www.chainfire.eu/articles/118/Triangle_Away_vs_Samsung/ </div></div><label for=\"post131\" class=\"read-more-trigger\"></label>"},

Story The War of Magi left little but ashes and misery in its wake. Even magic itself had vanished from the world. Now, a thousand years later, humankind has remade the world through the power of iron, gunpowder, steam engines, and other machines and technologies.  But there is one who possesses the lost power of magic--a young girl name Terra whom the evil Empire has kept enslaved in an effort to harness her power as weapon. This leads to a fateful meeting between Terra and a young man named Locke. Their harrowing escape from the Empire's clutches sets in motion a series of events that touches countless lives and leads to one inevitable conclusion.   Features -  All graphics have been painstakingly recreated, bringing the world of FINAL FANTASY VI to your mobile device for the very first time! Kazuko Shibuya, one of the graphics designers involved in the FINAL FANTASY series from the very start, personally worked on the main characters and supervised the recreation of the game's graphics.  -  Square Enix's vast experience in A-list smartphone RPG titles has been harnessed in implementing intuitive user-friendly controls that make the game easy to play on touch screens. The battle interface has received particular attention, with a complete overhaul for use on your smartphone.  -  This smartphone release includes the new magicites and events that were introduced in the 2006 remake.  -  Some events have been optimized to be played with user-friendly touch controls.   ************************* Certain in-game conditions may cause the app to close unexpectedly on select devices.

With this application you will be able to joke farts ringing your phone. Only select an option from the combo and wave your mobile device.   History of Farts:  Farts are thought to have originated in the time before mass evolution when every life form was a small microbe. Farts were used a boost application to escape predators, which then evolved into a naturalrepellent. Then, a few young males needing something to occupy their time while hunting later pioneered its evolution just because they found it entertaining, and passed the art down to every generation of boys since by anal tradition. Farting was even a rite of passage for many in the ancient world, a boy might have to prove himself by out-farting the older males of his tribe. Aristotle was the first to insist that  fart logic  is the only logic undeniably true, and indeed:  He who denied it, supplied it.  Later, Descartes based his fundamental ontology on the phrase:  I fart, therefore I am.   Along side it's historical use as weaponry at war, Fartium also was an early free form anaesthetic well known to the Continental European Tribes although considered uncivilized by the Greeks and Romans who preferred to just throw the sick to the lions. Then for the longest time it was considered vulgar.  In the 20th century, the fart joke was reestablished as the main medium for experiencing a fart. Gone were the days of seeing it as a noble art. Despite this, direct facial Fartium exposure rose to prominent as a form of torture, and became known as giving someone a helping of  beef-stew.  This would have been seen as barbaric in earlier ages, but in the context of the post-modern period, the etiquette of planting one's butt in the face of another and ripping a fart was literally blown out the window. The feminist movement started as a reaction to this practice, which was normally perpetrated by males onto their little sisters--little brothers, as everyone knows, enjoy being farted on.  In the 21st century, Apple is currently creating an amazing product, the  iFart . It will allow you to fart into a microphone, and the frequency of your fart will cause your music player to choose the song your fart wants to hear most. It has been rumored that Microsoft, in response, is working to develop  eFarts,  which will allow a user to attach a fart to an email and send it to another user. The incorporation of farting into the Wii and social media shows us that farts will probably become more and more digitized. We may even cease needing males to produce them. </div></div><label for=\"post1256\" class=\"read-more-trigger\"></label>"},

Big <div class=\"read-more-target\"> 2.0 feature and stabilty update available now !!  B.iCycle is THE next generation cycling computer app for your smartphone !!  ***** As seen on FOXNews ***** --- FOXNews says:  Very cool!  ---   Recent new features at a glance:  - Post tracks to Facebook or Twitter - Continuous power efficient recording for up to 6 hours of battery life - GPS auto pause detection stops the timer automatically during a standstill - The only app that provides OpenCycleMap with highlighted bike paths, contour lines and biker POIs   B.iCycle provides all the information you need on the bike. Our stylish user interface combined with maximum ease of use create a new experience on the bike that beats an ordinary bike computer by far!  FEATURES  - Accurate values for current speed, average speed, maximum speed, total distance, trip distance, current altitude, climbed altitude, burned calories as well as trip time. Units can be set to US or metric.  - Watch your bike automatically move on the map and zoom in on your trail  - Receive your trips via email (KML und GPX) and review them at home (e.g., with Google Earth) or share them with other bikers. You can send the data after each ride or anytime later from your track history (e.g. when there is no cellular network available).  - Suspend, pause, and resume for trips allows you to receive calls or take a break  Based on countless test rides and refinement with all major Android phones we measure trip performance with maximum precision of the built in GPS. In contrast to standard cyclometers you do not have to calibrate B.iCycle to your bike. It just works - out of the box. For the full experience we recommend to use a bike mount.  BUT THERE IS ONE MORE THING!  A MAP! Including bike trails! Even offroad you will not get lost while biking: Somebody from the huge OpenStreetMap community has already been there and mapped the trail for you! A community of more than 150.000 people is constantly mapping bike trails around the globe!   B.iCycle stores map data on SD card. That saves battery on the ride and allows you to preload the map when you are biking in an area with no cellular connection or abroad. Just browse the map at home in the area and zoom level that you desire and it will be there during the trip.  This really brings biking to the next level! B.iCycle makes perfect use of what your phone can do with GPS, connectivity and the amazing screen resolution.  And watching your tracks at home is more fun then ever, especially after a hard workout!  GET FREE UPDATES SOON!  The B.iCycle user base is thrilled by the mapped bike trails and the intuitive and sleek UI. Now it's your turn! Our team is eager to get your feedback and implement cool new stuff. We have cool stuff in the pipeline and all future updates will be for free!  B.iCycle - BIKING WILL NEVER BE THE SAME AGAIN! </div></div><label for=\"post1875\" class=\"read-more-trigger\"></label>"},

Once you put books on your device using one of the connection methods described below you can: - view a book's metadata (author, tags, series, rating, dates, etc.). - sort and group books by their metadata. - see book lists by cover or by list. - mark books read and sync this information with calibre. - launch your book reader application to read a book (works with most reader applications except for Amazon Kindle).  2) CC can connect to calibre over WiFi and be detected by calibre as a device. Once connected, you use calibre to move books to and from your device. Calibre automatically updates all the book metadata stored by CC to match the latest in your library. No other app, reader or browser, offers this level of integration with calibre.  3) CC can connect to calibre's content server over WiFi to browse your library and download books to your device.  For more information see our FAQ (http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=188899)  Notes:  1) CC is not a reader app. You must install and use one of the many excellent reader apps available.  2) CC requires that you use calibre calibre 0.9.02 or later, available at http://calibre-ebook.com/. Some CC features such as syncing book read information require newer versions of calibre.  Seeing the benefits of Calibre Companion's features can take some time. Do not worry about the 15-minute refund window. If after exploring both kinds of connections you are not satisfied with CC, contact us and we will refund your purchase.  **** Permissions explanation: - Allow Wi-Fi multicast reception: multicast is required to be able to find calibre without requiring you to enter an IP address. - Users with Jellybean (Android 4.1): You will also see a permission about    Test access to protected storage ?. This is caused by a change Android is making regarding SD card access, and simply means our app can save books on your external storage. </div></div><label for=\"post1527\" class=\"read-more-trigger\"></label>"},
